              <h4>What is experiential learning?</h4>
              <p>
                Experiential learning is best described as learning by doing. As
                a Tuva student, you'll have opportunities to get hands-on
                experience that's directly relevant to your program of study and
                supports your career and work goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                These opportunities can take place inside or outside the
                classroom, and are led by an instructor, a Tuva professional, or
                an industry partner in the community.
