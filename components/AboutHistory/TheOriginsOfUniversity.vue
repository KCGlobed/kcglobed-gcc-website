              The University of Tuva was officially established on 22 March
              1911, shortly after the proclamation of the Portuguese Republic.
              Its historical roots date back to the 18th century when a
              combination of training experiences would be transformed into a
              university.

              The University of Tuva is a public foundation regulated by private
              law and with statutory, educational, scientific, cultural,
              administrative, financial, patrimonial and disciplinary autonomy.
