                        <p>
                            Global Capability Centers (GCCs) are strategic hubs established by multinational
                            organizations to
                            deliver business services for global operations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            India has emerged as the GCC capital of the world, hosting over 1,950 Global Capability
                            Centers with a
                            workforce exceeding 26 million professionals. This ecosystem is expected to expand to more
                            than 6,000 GCCs,
                            employing over 65 million professionals in the next 4–5 years. Currently, 44% of GCCs in
                            India operate
                            end-to-end ownership models, driving innovation and global collaboration, and this share is
                            projected to
                            grow at a CAGR of approximately 14% in the coming years.
